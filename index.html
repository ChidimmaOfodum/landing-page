      <h2>About Me.</h2>
      <h3>My name is Chidimma Ofodum and I am passionate about software development</h3>
      <p> My interest and subsequent intention for a career in tech was sparked my curious mind. I have always wondered the "magic" behind the wonderful things we see on our mobile applications and web pages. How are these softwares getting more intelligent with passing years? When I thought I have seen it all, there is yet another one to blow my mind away. I have always wanted to know and explore the tech world but it all seemed beyond my reach. Like a rocket science I would never figure out. I have also envisioned having a career that would constantly excite, motivate and challenge me. With no doubts, I can say that a career in tech will do that and a lot more for me. This is one of the major reasons why I am excited about the Intro to Digital Course which is more of a taster and an exciting awakening of what I am about to venture into. My goal for the future is making an impactful contribution towards technological advancement. <br><br>
        Without any prior coding knowledge, this has been quite a journey for me. It has been exciting to see the things I could do such as this page, designing a survey form and so on. I love fact that it is fun every bit of this way. This is not to say that I have not been stuck with a particular chunk of code. However, the joy of fishing out what is wrong and solving the problem is second to none. There is also an amazing support from CodeYourFuture organizers and volunteers via slack and weekly meeting. The tutorial video attached below has also been instrumental in bringing me to par with HTML and CSS.</p>

      <p>

        Apart from learning how to code, I also love playing chess and cooking. I learnt how to play about a year ago from a friend and I find it intriguing and mind tasking. Being a chess grand master sounds good but I would rather play chess for fun than as a professional. I also swim for fun and cook at my spare time.
        Regarding my personality, my friends would call me fun-loving, cheerful and vibrant. I love meeting people and exploring different cultures and ways of life.
